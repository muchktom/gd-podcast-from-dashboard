            <title>Dashboard Insights â€“ Jun 01, 2025</title>
            <description>Hello everyone,

                This is Paul from GoodData Daily Podcast, and I'm excited to share insights from our
                latest episode diving into the dynamic world of building sets. We explore the
                current market landscape, with a remarkable total of 6,165 sets available, and a
                notable annual increase, indicating a healthy and expanding collection. Licensed
                themes are seeing a robust growth rate of 7.4%, outpacing native themes at 6.25%,
                showcasing the strong market interest in franchised sets. Notably, the "Stranger
                Things" theme is leading with astonishing annual growth of 22.24%, despite having
                just three sets, underscoring its high demand.

                Moreover, when examining average prices, "Ghostbusters" tops the chart at $254.99
                per license, closely followed by "Stranger Things" at $199.99, highlighting their
                premium status. The episode captures the dynamic and imaginative growth in building
                sets, driven by diversity and increasing consumer interest. Dive into the details as
                we continue to build insights and imagination on GoodData Daily. Catch you with more
                insights tomorrow!

                Best,
                Paul
